# MCP

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is a software program that acts as a bridge between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external resources like databases, tools, and data sources. It enables LLMs to interact with these external systems in a standardized and secure way, allowing them to access information and perform actions on behalf of users. Integrated with Gmail Api, now it can send, read, update, filter and delete emails.
